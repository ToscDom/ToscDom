This project aims to develop an automated moderation system based on Deep Learning techniques, capable of identifying and filtering toxic, offensive, or inappropriate comments in real-time within an online platform. The model is designed to classify comments into multiple relevant categories, ensuring effective management of harmful content without compromising the user experience.

This repository provides scripts for creating a custom face detection system without using pre-trained models. The approach leverages Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for object detection, along with data augmentation, sliding windows, non-maximum suppression, FLAML library and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification.
